                <h2>Shida's Broom Closet?.. Lets Talk About it </h2>
                <p className='abtUsTxt'>Established June 2, 2019, I envisioned Shida’s Broom Closet to be a mutable space. A space that is sacred and non-judgmental to commune with spirit and practice spiritual teachings. Its is a place for like minded individuals to come together and share what they’ve learned along their journey and share wisdom to others. It is also a place for those just beginning their journey to ask questions and receive divine intuitive guidance from a trusted practitioner. In order to book a session with me, please create an account and once your account is created your have full access to the wealth of information available on the Shida’s Broom Closet Website.
